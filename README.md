# M端hle Agent
This Application has been crafted utilizing the programming language Rust and lets you engage in the classical board game "M端hle" in the following gamemodes: player vs player and player vs computer.

More on general information of how the board game works can be found on [purpurax.de](https://www.purpurax.de/m端hleagent/)



### Download and setup
For trying out the game without installing and compiling yourself, the website [purpurax.de](https://www.purpurax.de/m端hleagent/) provides a web-ui based application.
When deciding to install and compile the program yourself, please make sure this steps are executed correctly:
- Make sure you have installed Rust with the the package manager cargo (I recommend the standart installation from the rustup website)
- Inside the main.rs file, you can find a description on which factors can be modified, so that you can e.g. run the player vs computer gamemode or resize the window.
- The program simply can be run with the ```cargo run```
